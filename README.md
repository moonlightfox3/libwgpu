## About
`libwgpu` is a JavaScript library I made for simplifying the WebGPU API.

`examples/` contains examples of using the library, with a `.html` page and `.wgsl` shader(s) for each. *(Note: The example shader files have the extension `.r.wgsl` or `.c.wgsl` to indicate if they are render (vertex and fragment) or compute shaders. That is not required to use this library.)*

## Usage
Include `libwgpu.js` in an HTML file.
`libwgpu.js` contains JSDoc documentation on how to use this library.
